This fork add some features, such as an offset boundary box (only offsets your coords when you are within a set coordinate range)
and the ability to only offset when you are in a specific dimension.
It is recommended to delete (or rename) your old config file before launching.
### I did not add these new options to the config menu. They must be set by editing .minecraft/config/definitelymycoords/config.json
These changes don't work in the 'Custom' mode.

DefinitelyMyCoords helps you hide your coordinates on the F3 screen with 4 different modes.



# Why do I want this mod?

If you're a streamer or share your screen with somebody,
this mod could save you from leaking your coordinates.
While still being able to use F3 to measure distances,
check the direction you are facing, etc.

## Usage

To open the mods settings, press the `F6` key or your configured key.

## Modes

### Vanilla
[suggested by @JackyXYZGaming](https://github.com/agent-LuluDodo/DefinitelyMyCoords/issues/9)

Doesn't modify your position at all.

### Relative

**TLDR**: Changes your coords

The coordinates you enter are relative to your current positions. That means if you are standing at **100 60 -30** and enter **-10 5 20** your current coordinates will be **-10 5 20** and **0 0 0** will have turned into **-110 -55 50**.

### Absolute

**TLDR**: Changes **0 0 0**

The coordinates you enter are relative to **0 0 0**. In this case, if you are standing at **100 60 -30** and enter **-10 5 20** your current coordinates will turn into **90 65 -10** and **0 0 0** will be **-10 5 20**.

### Custom

This mode sets your coordinates upon opening F3 to **0 0 0**.

## Biome Spoofing
[suggested by @kittenvr](https://github.com/agent-LuluDodo/DefinitelyMyCoords/issues/5)

### On

To enable biome spoofing, enter a valid [biome id](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome#Biome_IDs) into the text widget.

### Off

To disable biome spoofing, simply leave the text empty.

## Block Rotations

### Obscure Rotations

If enabled, offset block rotations, flower positions, etc. by the same amount as blocks.<br>
*Note: This feature doesn't play well with `Mode: Custom`*
